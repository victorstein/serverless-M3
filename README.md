# M3 Serverless implementation
## Description

This project aims to create a tightly coupled microservice infrastructure where you can get all the benefits from a monolith with the micro services scalability.

in a nutshell, this is a NestJS monorepo infrastructure with an individual serverless file for each application, this will allow code sharing while still keeping the micro services independent from one another.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```
